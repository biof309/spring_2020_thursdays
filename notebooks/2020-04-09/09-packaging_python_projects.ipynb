    "**Resetting your base conda environment**: Assuming you have not created your own conda environments your only conda environment will be the base conda environment. Ideally we only use conda to install software into this environment. For various reasons we may not do this sometimes. As we continue to install software into conda environments they can start to get subtly broken and become difficult to install new software into them. One such example of this is that resolving dependencies takes a long time when we try to install some more software. There are [lots of ways](https://www.anaconda.com/understanding-and-improving-condas-performance/) to solve this last problem. Moving forward it is best practice to create new environments for new projects; creating an environment per project allows you to keep your dependencies concise and clean on a project basis and will prevent any dependencies issues when trying to resolve lots of dependencies. This is where conda really shines for ease and reproducibility.  \n",
