Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program. Emphasis is placed on foundational skills for automation, reproducibility, and sustainable development of code for scientific analysis.

There will be in-class demonstrations, and teaching using [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io). The course also consists of out of class learning using the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) learning platform. This allows students to practice and learn at your their pace with programming exercises that provide realtime feedback on mistakes.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
1. Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for keeping track of changes in your project and collaborating with others
1. Create working Python programs
1. Develop strategies for leveraging pre-existing solutions to analysing your scientific data
1. Be aware of tools and strategies that help sustainably develop robust software for scientific analysis
1. Have a deep understanding of the basic structures in Python (e.g. lists, dicts, etc)
1. Perform data analysis and visualization with Python
1. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project


Preparation before class
------------------

**Please review the course [setup](course_setup.md) requirements**

Each student is encouraged to bring their own laptop to each class.

*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional feat.*

Laptops are available to borrow for class on an as needed basis. There are also Data Processing Stations available to use in the library.

Grading
-------

Use the [grading](course_rubric.md) rubric for the course. Read it. Internalize it. Live by it. It is like being given the answers before the test. There are no tricks here: we grade you according to the rubric!

Communication
------------

Please try to ask your questions during class, if at all possible.

**Before contacting us**, please check to see if your question has already been answered elsewhere, e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you cannot find the answer, please make sure to ask your question thoughtfully (https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and provide everything needed to answer e.g. code, error message, dataset, etc.

In general, please use the [course gitter channel](https://gitter.im/biof309/community) to communicate with classmates and instructors. In case of personal/private question/concerns, please use the private chat functionality of gitter.

In case of an emergency, please use [gitter](https://gitter.im/biof309) *and* an email.


Course Materials
----------------

Course materials are available in the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/biof309/spring_2020_thursdays.git).


Recommended Books
-----------------

**There is no required textbook for this course.**
We do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake Vanderplas. Both of these books are available free on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in Jupyter Notebook form. The code for [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but the text is only available in the printed copy of the book. For maximum enjoyment, consider working through the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way (ebook freely available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.

2. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)

    Since Fall 2017, the very nice folks at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) have been generously supporting our class via their [DataCamp for the Classroom](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education) initiative.
    
    This program give us free 6 month access to DataCamp's awesome Data VisualizationðŸ“Š, Machine LearningðŸ¤–, and Data Science learning materials.
    
    We will discuss the most interesting examples from DataCamp during class and point out others to be reviewed outside of class.

3. [GitHub](https://github.com/)

    All of the course materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    Before accessing the [course materials repo](https://github.com/biof309/spring_2020_thursdays.git), you should know that
    * it is likely to be under constant development throughout the semester and
    * you are not expected to work through _everything_ contained therein!
